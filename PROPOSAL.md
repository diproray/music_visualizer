# CS 126 Project Proposal: Flappy Illini
A C++ application remake of the iconic [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)! :bird:

## Summary (or tl;dr)
__A C++ clone of Flappy Bird, using [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) and [ofBox2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d) (and possibly, [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/)). The project will include special features beyond a basic Flappy Bird game such as: coin collection, level demarcations, game layout customizations, and hopefully [dynamic game difficulty balancing (DGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_game_difficulty_balancing) and split-screen multiplayer mode.__

## Description
The C++ application will be similar to Flappy Bird. 
There is a character, the bird, which has to be saved from hitting tubes as it "jumps" through the holes in these tubes. Attached below is a simple gif depiction of Flappy Bird.

Implementing this basic Flappy Bird game will require thinking about:
1. **Superimposition of the tubes over the background layout.** I intend to let the background be "built" in the application, rather than an image.
2. **An endless building of the game environment.** I need to figure out how to randomly generate the tubes and the holes in them to ensure a game of reasonable difficulty. 
3. **Physics behind the jumps of the bird.** I have to figure out how to model these jumps as minor trajectories the bird is thrown into.
After implementing a basic Flappy Bird game, I intend to add additional features, which are described below.
4. **Implementing a simple, yet fun, GUI** for Welcome screen, Game Over screen, Paused screen with some fun features beyond the ordinary expectations from a game.

I intend to add quite a few additional features to the basic Flappy Bird game.

## Additional Features
1. **Game Layout Elements Customization**: Customization of background layout, colors of background and tubes, bird etc.
2. **Level Demarcations**: Demarcate environment into levels, and adjust scores accoordingly.
3. **Collection of Coins, Jackpots, Mystery Boxes, Power Packs**: Common game elements which can be incorporated into Flappy Bird. Power packs - allowing the user to fly through a certain number of tubes automatically - will require some thinking as to how the system would display the animation for passing through tubes with holes at random heights.
4. **Split-screen Mulitplayer mode**: Splitting the window into half, vertically or horizontally, to allow two (or possibly, more) players to play the game simultaneously.
5. **[Dynamic Game Difficulty Balancing (DGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_game_difficulty_balancing)**: This one of the more complex extra features I would like to add, and it would be cool if it can be pulled off. DGB tries to adapt the game environment to the player's proficiency. Doing so would require a mathematical approach to determining what variation in the heights of adjacent tube holes corresponds to what degree of difficulty. A way I thought I could tune my game to increase in difficulty is to model a "cost" function which on minimizing increases difficulty by a bit, and use past tube hole heights data to perform stochastic gradient descent on the coefficients of the function to generate an increasingly difficult game environment. As is evident, I am trying to apply the notion of [stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) from machine learning here. In case this turns out to be very complex or very time consuming, I hope to figure out a more intuitive/practical way or increasing game difficulty.

## Libraries Being Used
1. [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/): The framework used to build the game environment and GUIs.
2. [ofBox2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d): An openFrameworks add-on that can help simulate the physics of the bird jumping.
3. [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/): A game-engine library for C++. I am not yet sure if I will use this, but it is potentially very useful in making game environment customizations easy (primarily because of it being able to parse TMX files generated by [Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/)).
4. An ML library for C++ to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent. I am still looking into any alternative lightweight libraries (game data shouldn't be too large), but for now, [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) is what I plane to use for DGB.

My development environment will be [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## Rough (Ideal) Plan / Checkpoints for the next 4 Weeks
1. **Week 1: Running Prototype of a basic Flappy Bird game, Detailed Plan for Next Phase**
    * Get a Flappy Bird game up and running as an openFrameworks application.
    * Plan the next phase - adding GUIs, improving game engine code, etc.
2. **Week 2: Running, Visually Pleasing Prototype of the game mentioned in Decription**
3. **Week 3: Tweaking Code for Layout Customizations, and Adding Code for non-trivial, but non-difficult, additional features**
4. **[Final] Week 4: Achieve DGB. Ensure extensive documentation and project file structures. Polish any rough game details.**
