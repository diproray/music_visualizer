# Log/Development of the CS 126 Final Project

## #1
1. Project set up for intial proposal unsuccessful, because of some problem with the Allegro library's working on OS X. Proposal changed.
2. Reasonable progress made on a rudimentary design of the music visualization application. 
    * I have been able to implement two visualizations of the music: one with equalizer level bars, and one with a graph of shifting vertices whose edges
      and size change with the change in music tone and change colours.
